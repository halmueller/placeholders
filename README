These are placeholder images for use in your iOS project. Add these
images and you can tell which image size is being loaded.

All launch image orientations and sizes, and all icon sizes, are
represented, using default names. Images were created using Acorn,
from Flying Meat (http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/). Acorn and PNG formats
are provided. Colors and fonts were chosen with the intent of making
designers' eyes bleed, and you should replace these placeholders in
your project as soon as you can.

Enjoy!
